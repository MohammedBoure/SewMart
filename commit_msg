fix(service-worker): ensure full offline functionality by serving cached resources only
    -Modified service-worker.js to serve cached resources exclusively, removing network fetch attempts for complete offline support.
    -Updated fetch event to return index.html for navigation requests and ignore non-GET requests.
    -Incremented CACHE_NAME to sewmart-cache-v3 to force cache refresh.
    -Removed sync-related logic (queueRequest, push, notificationclick) as the app is fully offline.
