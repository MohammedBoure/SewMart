feat(products): add low-stock filter button and unsold days threshold input

- Added a button on the products page to filter and view low-stock products.
- Introduced an input field to define the number of days after which a product is considered "unsold".
- Enhanced the reports page to display unsold products with a color gradient from yellow to red, indicating how long each product has remained unsold.
